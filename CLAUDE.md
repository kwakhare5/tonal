# CLAUDE.md — ToneShift Chrome Extension
## Project Context for AI Agent (Antigravity / Claude / Gemini)

---

## What Is This Project

**ToneShift** is a free Chrome extension that works as a two-way tone translator inside Gmail, Slack (browser), LinkedIn, and WhatsApp Web.

It solves two problems for Gen Z users and non-native English speakers:

**Problem 1 — Sending:**
User types a casual message ("hey can u send me that doc") and needs it to sound professional before sending. One click converts it to the right tone level.

**Problem 2 — Receiving:**
User receives a long formal/corporate message and can't be bothered to parse it. They select the text and one click tells them what it actually means in plain English.

**The tone slider has 3 levels:**
- **Texting** — Very casual, like texting a friend. Lowercase, short, no punctuation overthinking.
- **Work Chat** — Casual professional. How a normal person talks to a colleague they like.
- **Corporate** — Formal, complete sentences, professional vocabulary. For boss emails, clients, HR.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Extension framework | Chrome Extension Manifest V3 | Required for Chrome |
| Languages | Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS | Zero dependencies, fast load |
| AI API | Google Gemini 2.0 Flash | Free tier, fast, sufficient quality |
| API endpoint | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent` | Free, no credit card needed |
| Storage | `chrome.storage.sync` | Sync settings across devices |
| Background worker | Service Worker (MV3) | Required by MV3 spec |

**No npm. No build step. No React. No bundler.** Pure vanilla JS files the browser loads directly.

## How It Works — Full Flow

### Sending Flow (Casual → Formal)
1. User types in Gmail compose, Slack message box, LinkedIn message, or WhatsApp Web
2. `content.js` detects the text input and injects a small "ToneShift ⚡" button next to it
3. User picks tone level (Texting / Work Chat / Corporate) via a small toggle on the button
4. User clicks the button
5. `content.js` reads the text from the input field and sends a message to `background.js`
6. `background.js` calls the Gemini API with the text + tone instructions
7. Gemini returns the rewritten text
8. `content.js` replaces the text in the input field with the rewritten version
9. User reviews it and sends (or edits further)
10. There's an Undo button that restores the original text

### Receiving/Decoding Flow (Formal → Plain)
1. User selects any text on the page (a received email, a Slack message, anything)
2. A small floating "Decode ↓" button appears near their cursor/selection
3. User clicks it
4. `content.js` sends the selected text to `background.js`
5. Gemini returns a plain English explanation
6. A small popup/tooltip appears near the selection showing the decoded version
7. Popup has a "Copy" button and auto-dismisses after 8 seconds or when clicked away

## Supported Platforms

The extension injects into these specific domains:

```json
"host_permissions": [
  "https://mail.google.com/*",
  "https://app.slack.com/*",
  "https://www.linkedin.com/*",
  "https://web.whatsapp.com/*"
]
```

Each platform has different DOM structures. The content script must handle each one:

| Platform | Input selector strategy |
|---|---|
| Gmail | `div[role="textbox"][aria-label*="compose"]` or `.Am.Al.editable` |
| Slack | `.ql-editor`, `[data-qa="message_input"]`, `[data-lexical-editor]` |
| LinkedIn | `.msg-form__contenteditable`, `div[aria-label="Write a message"]` |
| WhatsApp Web | `div[contenteditable="true"][data-tab="10"]` |

## The Gemini API Integration

### API Key Setup
- User gets a free API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- User pastes it into the extension popup
- It's stored in `chrome.storage.sync` (encrypted by Chrome, never sent anywhere except Gemini)

### API Call (in background.js)

```javascript
const GEMINI_URL = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent";

async function callGemini(text, mode, toneLevel, apiKey) {
  const systemPrompt = buildSystemPrompt(mode, toneLevel);
  
  const response = await fetch(`${GEMINI_URL}?key=${apiKey}`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      contents: [{
        parts: [
          { text: systemPrompt },
          { text: text }
        ]
      }],
      generationConfig: {
        maxOutputTokens: 500,
        temperature: 0.4
      }
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  return data.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text.trim();
}
```

### System Prompts

**SEND mode — Texting level:**
```
You are a tone converter. Rewrite the message below to sound like a casual text between friends.
Use lowercase freely, be short, contractions are fine, skip unnecessary punctuation.
Do not change the core meaning. Output ONLY the rewritten message, nothing else.
```

**SEND mode — Work Chat level:**
```
You are a tone converter. Rewrite the message below to sound like a normal professional 
talking to a colleague they're comfortable with. Friendly but clear. Not stiff, not too casual.
Do not use corporate jargon. Output ONLY the rewritten message, nothing else.
```

**SEND mode — Corporate level:**
```
You are a tone converter. Rewrite the message below in a formal, professional tone 
suitable for emailing a manager, client, or HR. Complete sentences, proper punctuation,
polite and clear. No slang. Output ONLY the rewritten message, nothing else.
```

**RECEIVE mode (decode) — always plain English:**
```
You are a decoder. The user received this formal/corporate message and wants to understand 
what it actually means in simple plain English. 
Give a 1-3 sentence plain English summary of what this message is asking or saying.
Be direct. Use everyday language. Start directly with the meaning, no preamble.
Output ONLY the plain English explanation.
```

## UI Design Requirements

### Injected Send Button (appears in text inputs)
- Small, unobtrusive pill button: "⚡ ToneShift"
- Positioned: bottom-right of text input area, not blocking text
- Shows current tone level: "⚡ Texting", "⚡ Work Chat", "⚡ Corporate"
- Click the label area = run conversion
- Click the tone name = cycle through the 3 levels
- Loading state: spinner + "Converting..."
- Done state: "↩ Undo" button appears (restores original)
- Disappears cleanly if the input is removed from DOM

### Floating Decode Button (appears on text selection)
- Only appears when user selects 20+ characters of text
- Small floating button near the selection: "Decode ↓"
- On click: shows a tooltip/card with the plain English version
- Card has: decoded text + "📋 Copy" button
- Card dismisses on click-outside or pressing Escape
- Does NOT appear inside editable fields (only on read-only content)

### Toast Notifications
- Bottom center of screen
- Dark background (#1a1a2e), colored text based on type
- 3 types: success (green), error (red), info (purple)
- Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds

### Extension Popup (popup.html)
- Dark theme (#0d0d1a)
- API key input (password field)
- Default tone selector (which level to start on)
- "Connected" badge when key is saved
- Link to get free Gemini API key
- Simple, clean, 320px wide

## Important Technical Constraints

### MV3 Service Worker Rules
- `background.js` is a SERVICE WORKER — it cannot access the DOM
- All fetch/API calls must happen in `background.js`, NOT in `content.js`
- Use `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` / `chrome.runtime.onMessage` to communicate between content.js and background.js
- Service workers are stateless — don't store anything in memory, use `chrome.storage`

### Content Script Injection
- Use `MutationObserver` to watch for dynamically added elements (Gmail, Slack are SPAs)
- Keep a `WeakSet` of already-injected inputs to avoid duplicate buttons
- Clean up injected UI when elements are removed from DOM

### Cross-Origin Requests
- Only `background.js` (service worker) can call the Gemini API
- The host permission `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/*` must be in `manifest.json`
- Never put API key in content scripts (security risk)

### Text Input Handling
- Gmail, Slack, LinkedIn use `contenteditable` divs, NOT `<textarea>` or `<input>`
- To set text in contenteditable: use `document.execCommand("insertText")` after selecting all
- Always dispatch `input` and `change` events after setting text so the app's state updates
- Fallback: set `innerHTML` + dispatch events manually

## Manifest.json Requirements

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "ToneShift — Two-Way Tone Translator",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Convert casual messages to professional, or decode corporate speak into plain English. Works in Gmail, Slack, LinkedIn, WhatsApp Web.",
  "permissions": ["storage", "activeTab"],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://mail.google.com/*",
    "https://app.slack.com/*",
    "https://www.linkedin.com/*",
    "https://web.whatsapp.com/*",
    "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/*"
  ],
  "background": { "service_worker": "background.js" },
  "content_scripts": [{
    "matches": [
      "https://mail.google.com/*",
      "https://app.slack.com/*",
      "https://www.linkedin.com/*",
      "https://web.whatsapp.com/*"
    ],
    "js": ["content.js"],
    "css": ["styles.css"],
    "run_at": "document_idle"
  }],
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": { "16": "icons/icon16.png", "48": "icons/icon48.png", "128": "icons/icon128.png" }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Handle these specific cases gracefully:

| Error | User-facing message |
|---|---|
| No API key set | "Add your free Gemini API key in the ToneShift popup ↗" |
| API key invalid (401) | "API key not working. Check it in the popup ↗" |
| Rate limit hit (429) | "Too many requests. Wait a moment and try again." |
| Input is empty | Don't show button (or grey it out) |
| Input too short (<10 chars) | Toast: "Type more before converting" |
| Network error | "Connection issue. Check your internet." |

---

## What NOT To Do

- Do NOT use React, Vue, or any framework
- Do NOT use npm or any build tools
- Do NOT use `localStorage` (use `chrome.storage` instead)
- Do NOT put the API key in `content.js`
- Do NOT inject UI into `<iframe>` elements
- Do NOT call Gemini from `content.js` directly
- Do NOT add the extension to sites not in the host_permissions list
- Do NOT make the injected button too large or visually intrusive
- Do NOT block text input while the API call is loading

---

## Testing Checklist

After building, verify each of these manually:

- [ ] Button appears in WhatsApp Web input
- [ ] Clicking the tone label cycles through Texting / Work Chat / Corporate
- [ ] Conversion replaces text correctly in Gmail (contenteditable)
- [ ] Conversion replaces text correctly in Slack (Quill/Lexical editor)
- [ ] Undo button restores original text
- [ ] Selecting received text shows "Decode ↓" button
- [ ] Decode shows plain English popup
- [ ] Copy button in decode popup works
- [ ] Error toasts appear for missing API key
- [ ] Extension doesn't crash on non-supported pages

## Monetization Plan (Future)

- **Free tier**: 20 conversions/day using user's own Gemini API key (always free)
- **Pro ($3/month)**: Unlimited conversions, our managed API key, no setup needed
- **Team ($9/month per seat)**: Shared settings, custom tone presets, analytics

This CLAUDE.md should give you (the AI agent) everything needed to build the full extension without asking clarifying questions. Start with `manifest.json`, then `background.js`, then `content.js`, then `styles.css`, then `popup.html` + `popup.js`.
