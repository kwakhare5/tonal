# CLAUDE.md â€” Agent Rules + Project Context

## Overview

Single file. Contains always-active rules + project info.

---

## MANDATORY â€” THE BREATH (before any action, every session)

Read in order:

1. This file (you are here)
2. `C:\Users\kwakh\.gemini\SKILLS_INDEX.md` â€” skills registry

Proof required: state one detail from each before proceeding.
Skip = stop, apologize, re-read.

> First session or stack decision only:
> Read `C:\Users\kwakh\.gemini\GEMINI.md` for tech preferences.

## ALWAYS-ACTIVE RULES

**R0 â€” SENTINEL HEADER**

Before ending any session: update task.md + walkthrough.md. Both. No skipping.
task.md = what. walkthrough.md = why.

**R13 â€” CONTEXT TRUNCATION**

## Project Context for Antigravity

**Tonal** is a free Chrome extension that works as a two-way tone translator inside Gmail, Slack (browser), and LinkedIn. It uses a Cloudflare Worker proxy to route requests to Groq (Llama 3.3 70B) for high-fidelity, preamble-free rephrasing.

It solves two problems for Gen Z users and non-native English speakers:

**Problem 1 â€” Sending:**
User types a casual message ("hey can u send me that doc") and needs it to sound professional before sending. One click converts it to the right tone level.

**Problem 2 â€” Receiving:**
User receives a long formal/corporate message and can't be bothered to parse it. They select the text and one click tells them what it actually means in plain English.

**The tone levels are:**

- **Casual texting** â€” Lowercase, minimal punctuation, short-form (u, r, sry).
- **Work Chat** â€” Friendly professional. How a normal person talks to a colleague.
- **Formal professional** â€” High-status executive English. Clear, authoritative, and polite.

## How It Works â€” Full Flow

### Sending Flow (Casual â†’ Formal)

1. User types in Gmail compose, Slack message box, or LinkedIn message
2. `content.js` detects the text input and injects a small "Tonal" pill button
3. User picks tone level via the **Popover Dropdown**
4. User clicks the button (or tone item)
5. `content.js` reads text and sends to `background.js`
6. `background.js` calls the Cloudflare Proxy (Groq Llama 3.3 70B)
7. Proxy returns the rewritten text
8. `content.js` replaces the text in the input field
9. There's an Undo button that restores the original text
10. **Real-Time Sync**: Preference changes in the popup update all active pills across all tabs instantly.

### Receiving/Decoding Flow (Formal â†’ Plain)

1. User selects any text on the page
2. A small floating "Decode" button appears near the cursor (with **Magnetic Pull**)
3. `content.js` sends text to `background.js`
4. Groq returns a plain English explanation
5. A **Viewport-Aware** card appears (automatically flips position if near screen edge)
6. Card has a "Copy" button (turns green on success) and auto-dismisses
